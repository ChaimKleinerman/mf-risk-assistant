# Multi-Family Property Risk Assessment - Architecture Documentation

## Architecture Overview

The system follows a modern microservices architecture with two main components:

1. **Backend (FastAPI)**

   - RESTful API service
   - AI-powered risk assessment engine
   - Modular design with clear separation of concerns:
     - Models: Data structures and validation
     - Services: Business logic
     - Prompts: AI prompt templates

2. **Frontend (React)**
   - Single Page Application (SPA)
   - Component-based architecture
   - Responsive design for all devices
   - Optimized data fetching and caching

## Technology Choices

### Backend Stack

- **FastAPI**: Chosen for its high performance, automatic API documentation, and modern Python features
- **Google Gemini AI**: Selected for its advanced language model capabilities and cost-effectiveness
- **FastMCP**: Used for structured prompt management and versioning
- **Pydantic**: Provides robust data validation and serialization

### Frontend Stack

- **React**: Industry standard for building interactive UIs
- **TypeScript**: Adds type safety and better developer experience
- **Vite**: Fast development server and optimized builds
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development
- **React Query**: Advanced data fetching, caching, and state management
  - Automatic background refetching
  - Optimistic updates
  - Infinite scrolling support
  - Request deduplication

## Data Management Strategy

### React Query Implementation

- **Caching Strategy**:
  - In-memory cache for risk assessment results
  - Stale-while-revalidate pattern
  - Configurable cache time and stale time
- **Performance Optimizations**:
  - Automatic request deduplication
  - Parallel queries for related data
  - Prefetching for anticipated user actions
- **Error Handling**:
  - Automatic retry on failure
  - Error boundary integration
  - Graceful degradation

## Challenges and Solutions

### 1. AI Integration

**Challenge**: Integrating AI responses with structured data
**Solution**: Implemented FastMCP for prompt management and structured response handling

### 2. Dependency Management

**Challenge**: Version conflicts between FastAPI, FastMCP, and Pydantic
**Solution**: Carefully managed dependency versions and used flexible version constraints

### 3. Real-time Updates

**Challenge**: Providing immediate feedback during risk assessment
**Solution**:

- Implemented streaming responses from the AI model
- React Query for optimistic updates and background refetching

### 4. Performance

**Challenge**: Handling multiple concurrent risk assessments
**Solution**:

- Asynchronous request handling with FastAPI
- Efficient prompt caching
- Optimized response streaming
- React Query for client-side caching and request management
